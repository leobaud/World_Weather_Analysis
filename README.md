# World_Weather_Analysis

For the new modifications to the PlanMyTrip app, you are asked to add more data to the database, or cities DataFrame, so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker. You’ll also need to add the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours so that customers can filter the DataFrame using input statements based on the temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing. Finally, you’ll need to create a directions layer Google map that shows the directions between multiple cities for travel.

In this challenge, you will continue to build on your Python programming skills using try-except blocks, input statements and nested decision statements, logical expressions, and Pandas methods and attributes to make an API request and build a new DataFrame. You will then filter the DataFrame to create a marker layer map, and a directions layer Google map that shows directions to travel between multiple cities.

The purpose is to implement the feedback from the beta testers, which is listed below.

- A weather description to the pop-up markers for customers so that they know what the weather is as they are traveling
- A notation in the search criteria to indicate if it is raining or snowing for customers who are making travel decisions in real-time
- A map that shows the directions for customers’ travel itinerary
